# baseball_data_cleaning_Python
The data which I am using for this project is about Baseball Players Statistics from ESPN

Given this link: https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910.
I copied it and put it into an Excel sheet, where I converted it into a csv file. 

Steps I took to clean the data in this project include: 
1. Understand the data
2. Check and handle Null values
3. Check and handle duplicates
4. Renaming columns to be more understable
5. Changing variables to its correct data types
6. Manipulating String objects
7. Removing and Adding Columns
8. Basic EDA
